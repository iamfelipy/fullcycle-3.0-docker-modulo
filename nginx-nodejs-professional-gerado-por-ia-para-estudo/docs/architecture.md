# Architecture Documentation

## System Overview

This application follows a microservices architecture with the following components:

### Components

1. **Nginx (Reverse Proxy)**
   - Handles incoming HTTP requests
   - Routes traffic to Node.js application
   - Provides load balancing capabilities
   - Implements security headers

2. **Node.js Application**
   - Express.js web server
   - Handles business logic
   - Manages database connections
   - Provides REST API endpoints

3. **MySQL Database**
   - Persistent data storage
   - ACID compliance
   - Connection pooling support

### Data Flow

1. Client request → Nginx
2. Nginx → Node.js application
3. Node.js → MySQL database
4. Response flows back through the chain

### Security Considerations

- All containers run as non-root users
- Network isolation between services
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- HTTPS ready configuration

### Scalability

- Horizontal scaling ready
- Load balancer configuration
- Database connection pooling
- Stateless application design
